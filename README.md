# Football Analytics with Deep Learning and Computer Vision

## Overview

This project utilizes deep learning techniques and computer vision to analyze and gain tactical insights from football match videos. The goal is to detect and track key objects in the game, such as players, referees, and the ball, while also analyzing player movement and positioning using pose estimation. With the aid of modern models like **YOLOv8** for object detection and **Mediapipe** for pose estimation, we aim to create a system that visualizes and analyzes the dynamics of football games for tactical and strategic insights.

The project consists of multiple components:
1. Object Detection for identifying players, referees, and the ball.
2. Pose Estimation for tracking player positions and movements.
3. Tactical Visualization for visualizing formations and key tactical moments.

## Project Components

### 1. **Object Detection with YOLOv8**

#### What is YOLOv8?
**YOLO (You Only Look Once)** is a popular object detection model known for its speed and accuracy. The model performs detection in a single pass, which makes it suitable for real-time applications. **YOLOv8** is the latest iteration of this model and improves both speed and accuracy compared to its predecessors.

#### How Object Detection Works in This Project:
- **Goal**: Detect key objects in football match footage such as players, referees, and the ball.
- **Training**: The model is fine-tuned using a custom dataset that includes images annotated with bounding boxes. These annotations represent the position of objects within the images (players, ball, referee).
- **Inference**: After training, the YOLOv8 model is used to perform object detection on new video frames to detect players, referees, and the ball. The model outputs bounding boxes around the detected objects along with their respective class labels.

##### Key Features:
- Detects **players**, **referees**, and **the ball**.
- Outputs bounding boxes around the objects, allowing further analysis.
- Trained on custom annotations in YOLO format.

#### Example of YOLOv8 Output:
After running the trained YOLOv8 model on a new video frame, it can output something like this:
- **Bounding boxes** for detected players, referees, and the ball.
- **Class labels** identifying each object, e.g., player, referee, ball.

This provides a way to visually locate players and objects on the field in every frame of the match.

### 2. **Pose Estimation with Mediapipe**

#### What is Mediapipe?
**Mediapipe** is a framework developed by Google for building cross-platform machine learning pipelines. For this project, **Mediapipe Pose** is used to detect and track the body keypoints of players. It identifies 33 keypoints on the human body, which include the head, shoulders, elbows, knees, and ankles.

#### How Pose Estimation Works in This Project:
- **Goal**: Track the body posture and movements of players during a match to gain insight into their actions.
- **Pose Estimation**: Mediapipe is applied to each frame of the video to detect the positions of the body keypoints. These keypoints are used to understand the pose of the playersâ€”how they are moving, whether they are facing the ball, etc.

##### Key Features:
- Tracks **33 body keypoints** for each player in the video.
- Detects **player poses** to understand player movement and positioning.
- Enables visualizing player movements and orientations over time.

#### Example of Mediapipe Output:
After processing a video frame, the Mediapipe model will output a **skeleton** for each player, showing how the keypoints are connected to each other. These visualizations can help in analyzing player actions, such as:
- Running towards the ball
- Jumping for a header
- Tackling an opponent

### 3. **Tactical Visualization**

#### Why Tactical Visualization?
By combining the results of the object detection (from YOLOv8) and pose estimation (from Mediapipe), the system can generate insightful visualizations of football match tactics. These visualizations display key aspects like player positions on the field, team formations, and movement patterns.

#### How Tactical Visualization Works in This Project:
- **Pitch Drawing**: The system uses **matplotlib** to create a 2D football pitch and plot the positions of players at any given moment in the match.
- **Formation Mapping**: By observing the relative positions of players, the system can visualize the team's formation (e.g., 4-4-2, 4-3-3).
- **Movement Visualization**: It also tracks player movements over time to show how they shift during different phases of play (attack, defense).

##### Key Features:
- Visualizes **player positions** on a 2D football pitch.
- Plots the **team formation** and player movements.
- Uses **matplotlib** for rendering the pitch and player movements.

#### Example of Tactical Visualization:
After processing the match video, the system could generate a **formation chart** showing the relative positions of players at different times during the match. It could also highlight:
- Where the players tend to congregate (e.g., defense, attack).
- Movement patterns, such as players running in sync or a winger making runs down the sideline.

### 4. **Video Frame Processing**

#### What is Video Frame Processing?
This component processes a football match video, extracting individual frames to apply the object detection and pose estimation models. Each frame is processed sequentially to detect players, referees, and the ball and track player positions and movements.

#### How Frame Processing Works:
1. **Extract Frames**: The video is split into individual frames using `OpenCV`.
2. **Object Detection**: YOLOv8 is applied to each frame to detect players, referees, and the ball.
3. **Pose Estimation**: Mediapipe is applied to each player to estimate their pose (i.e., the position of key body points).
4. **Tactical Visualization**: Finally, the results are used to visualize player positions and movements on a football pitch.

#### Example Workflow:
1. Input a video (e.g., a match).
2. The system processes each frame:
   - **YOLOv8** detects players, referees, and the ball.
   - **Mediapipe** estimates the player poses.
   - **Matplotlib** visualizes the positions and formations.
3. Output a sequence of annotated frames or a summary video showing the tactical analysis.
